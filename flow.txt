The processor gets the data from BCS by getting connected through BCS_connector
Then it cleans all the data and processes it and returns the dataset to runner
The runners takes it and uploads the postgres DB and saves a file on a remote folder
Then the runner shares the dataset as an excel file through mailer 


Note:
Create separate files for each of the colors and follow altogether different approaches
